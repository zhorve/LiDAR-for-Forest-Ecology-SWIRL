# LiDAR for Forest Ecology

This course introduces the fundamentals of **LiDAR analysis for forest ecology** using the **`lidR`** package in R.  
You will learn to work with airborne LiDAR point clouds to derive canopy height models, tree-level metrics, and forest structural diversity from the plot level to landscapes.

## Course Lessons

### Lesson 1: Introduction to LiDAR Point Clouds
- Learn the differences between a digital surface model, digital terrain model, and a canopy height model
- Create a CHM
- Build understanding of point classifications through building classification and removal for urban forests

---

### Lesson 2: Individual Tree Analysis
- Detect and segment individual trees using NEON AOP LiDAR data
- Derive tree-level biometrics such as tree height
- Map tree density and mean tree height across landscapes

---

### Lesson 3: Forest Structural Diversity
- Quantify forest structural diversity from point clouds and CHMs
- Explore the structural differences between forest edge and interior plots
- Create wall-to-wall maps of structural diversity

---
