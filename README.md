# Introduction to LiDAR Swirl Course

This course introduces the fundamentals of **LiDAR data analysis for forest ecology applications** using the **`lidR`** package in R.

You will learn how to work with airborne LiDAR point clouds to derive terrain models, canopy structure, and tree-level metrics, and how to apply these products in ecological analyses.

📦 **lidR package**: https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR
