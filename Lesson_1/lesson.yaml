    Welcome to LiDAR for Forest Ecology! In this course, you
    will learn the fundamentals required to start using LiDAR
    for forest ecology applications.

- Class: text
  Output: |
    In this lesson, you will learn how to read in LiDAR data
    and how to generate a digital surface model (DSM), digital
    elevation model (DEM), and canopy height model (CHM). You 
    will also learn building classification and removal
    for urban forestry applications.

    First, load the `lidR` package by typing:
    library(lidR)
  CorrectAnswer: library(lidR)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="library(lidR)")
  Hint: Just type library(lidR)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Now load the `raster` package by typing:
    library(raster)
  CorrectAnswer: library(raster)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="library(raster)")
  Hint: Just type library(raster)

    LiDAR data is often provided in the form of a point cloud. Point clouds can be
    saved in a variety of formats, but the most common is .las. Let's try loading 
    a point cloud and looking through the basic properties. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: | 
    To load the point cloud, please enter the following into the terminal: 
    las= readLAS("Data/lesson_1_davenport_pc.las")
  CorrectAnswer: las= readLAS("Data/lesson_1_davenport_pc.las")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='las= readLAS("Data/lesson_1_davenport_pc.las")')
  Hint: |
    Just copy and paste the following into the terminal: 
    las= readLAS("Data/lesson_1_davenport_pc.las")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Our point cloud is now loaded into our R environment as an object called las. 
    Let's take a look at it by typing the following into your terminal(this will
    open a new window): plot(las)
  CorrectAnswer: plot(las)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(las)')
  Hint: |
    Just copy and paste the following into the terminal: plot(las)

  Output: | 
    This point cloud contains 3-D structural information for a urban forest in 
    Davenport, Iowa. You can see houses, trees, and two streams in the point cloud.
    Try rotating the point cloud by left clicking and dragging. You can also move
    the point cloud by right clicking and dragging.

  Output: |
    Try zooming in on the point cloud using the wheel on your mouse. You can see
    that the point cloud is made up of individual points in 3-D. Each of these points
    represents where a laser beam reflected off an object back to the airplane that 
    collected this data.

    Let's learn more about this point cloud by viewing the summary. Please copy
    and paste the following into your terminal: summary(las)
  CorrectAnswer: summary(las)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(las)')
  Hint: |
    Just copy and paste the following into your terminal: summary(las)

- Class: text
  Output: |
    The summary() function provides a lot of information, and it can be overwhelming. 
    Let's focus on a couple key pieces of information.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |
    One critical piece of information is the point density of the point cloud. Point
    density refers to the number of points per unit of area. Higher point density 
    allows for better distinction of features such as houses or tree structure. 
    However, with higher point density, the size of .las files increase, making 
    calculations more computationally expensive. Checking the point density of your
    point cloud should be one of the first things you do when exploring your data.

    What is the point density of the point cloud we loaded in? Do not include units
    in your answer.
  AnswerChoices: 13.47;10.53;8.12
  CorrectAnswer: 13.47
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='13.47')
  Hint: |
    Read the units carefully! We are looking for the density of POINTS / m^2

   Now we have inspected the point cloud, let's start processing!

- Class: text
  Output: |
   The first product we will create is a digital surface model or DEM. A digital
   surface model represents the highest point elevation for each cell. If you image 
   cloth descending from above onto the forest, the cloth would follow the contours
   of the canopy where there are trees, but fall to the ground where there are 
   canopy gaps.

   Let's try making a DSM from our point cloud. Enter the following into your terminal:
   dsm= rasterize_canopy(las, res= 1, algorithm = p2r())
  CorrectAnswer: dsm= rasterize_canopy(las, res= 1, algorithm = p2r())
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dsm= rasterize_canopy(las, res= 1, algorithm = p2r())')
  Hint: |
   Simply type dsm= rasterize_canopy(las, res= 1, algorithm = p2r()) into your terminal.
