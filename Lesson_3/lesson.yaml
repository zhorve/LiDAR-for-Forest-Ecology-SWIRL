    Welcome to Lesson 2 of LiDAR for Forest Ecology! In this lesson, you
    will learn how to quantify forest structural diversity using LiDAR through 
    an example ecological analysis comparing edge and core forest plots. Additionally, 
    you will use a LiDAR-derived canopy height model to create a wall-to-wall map 
    of forest structural diversity.

    Before we begin, let's first establish what forest structural diversity is 
    and why it is important. Forest structural diversity describes the complexity 
    of vegetation composition and spatial arrangement within a forest ecosystem. 
    Although long recognized as an important ecological attribute, structural 
    diversity has historically been difficult to measure at broad spatial scales. 
    Recent advances in airborne and terrestrial LiDAR enabled, quantification of 
    structural diversity at scale, allowing for greater advances in structural diversity 
    research. 

    Using LiDAR, structural diversity has been shown to underpin key ecosystem 
    functions, including productivity, nutrient cycling, and the support 
    of forest biodiversity through habitat provisioning. As a result, monitoring 
    structural diversity at scale has been recognized as essential for 
    informing forest management and promoting ecosystem resilience and functioning.

    To illustrate how forest structural diversity can be quantified using LiDAR, 
    we begin with an example analysis examining the effects of forest fragmentation. 
    Forest fragmentation breaks continuous forest landscapes into smaller, isolated 
    patches, creating contrasting environmental conditions between forest edges 
    and interior areas. In this first exercise, we will use airborne LiDAR to 
    evaluate how these edge effects influence forest structural diversity by 
    comparing edge and core forest plots around Lafayette, Indiana.

    In total, there are 20 total plots with 15 meter radii. Ten plots are located
    in core forests (> 30 meters from nearest edge) and ten plots are located
    on forest edges adjacent to agricultural land use. Note that the sample size
    is extremely limited-- in a real ecological analysis, a larger sample size would be 
    required.
